# Security Practices

## ðŸ”‘ Credential Management
```python
# Password hashing implementation
def hash_password(password, salt=None):
    if salt is None:
        salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)  # Cryptographic salt
    
    iterations = 100000  # PBKDF2 iteration count
    key = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(
        'sha256',
        password.encode('utf-8'),
        salt,
        iterations
    )
    return salt, key, iterations
```

## ðŸ›¡ GitHub Token Security


### `Never` hardcode tokens!

### Recommended: Environment variables

```python
token = os.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
```

### Alternative: Secure config files

```python
with open("config.json") as f:
    config = json.load(f)
token = config.get("github_token")
```

## ðŸ”’ Storage Security

- User Isolation: Each user has separate directory

- Encryption at Rest: Sensitive data encrypted

- File Permissions: Restricted to user-only access

- Git Exclusion: Sensitive paths in .gitignore:

users/
*.env
config.json

## ðŸš¨ Vulnerability Reporting

Report security issues to: pkotsorgios654@gmail.com.com
Response Timeline:

> 24 hours: Initial response

> 72 hours: Vulnerability assessment

> 7 days: Patch release

## Best Practices

- Use GitHub's fine-grained tokens with minimal permissions

- Rotate tokens every 90 days

- Enable 2FA on GitHub accounts

- Never commit sensitive data

- Audit logs regularly
